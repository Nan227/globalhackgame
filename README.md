## Inspiration
The inspiration for the MLH Memory Game project came from the desire to learn about game development using React and Vite while expressing gratitude to the MLH coach team for their invaluable support and guidance.

## What it does
The MLH Memory Game is a fun and interactive web game where players match pairs of pictures of MLH coaches within a grid. It serves as a way to hone cognitive skills while paying tribute to the mentors who have contributed to the learning journey.

## How we built it
We built the MLH Memory Game using React for the front-end and Vite for the development server and build tool. The game utilizes React components for the grid layout, image rendering, and game logic, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we encountered during the development process included implementing the game logic for matching pairs of images, optimizing performance for a smooth gameplay experience, and styling the user interface to be visually appealing and intuitive.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have successfully created a fully functional memory game using React and Vite, incorporating engaging gameplay mechanics and visually pleasing design. Additionally, we're proud to have expressed our gratitude to the MLH coach team through this project.

## What we learned
Through building the MLH Memory Game, we gained valuable experience in React development, including state management, component composition, and event handling. We also improved our skills in using Vite for efficient project setup and development workflow.

## What's next for MLH Memory Game
In the future, we plan to further enhance the MLH Memory Game by adding features such as different difficulty levels, multiplayer functionality, and additional customization options. We also aim to optimize the game for mobile devices to reach a wider audience of players. Additionally, we'll continue to explore new technologies and methodologies to improve the overall user experience and expand the project's capabilities.
